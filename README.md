# c++ projects :)

This is my attempt to like c++, I hate it because I need to code in c++ so i can get the grade and have follow the intructions like cant use libraries or stuff like yea thats the way we learn but still i hate it c++ so im trying to code some fun projects so i can like it 

I didn't come up with these projects i made deepseek list the projects to love/get good at c++ and it gave these projects! fun! there are not really i wanna build rn so these peojects are coool enough but also i got used to learning in a way odin project teaches yk like teach a topic then do a project based on it so i wanted same thing for c++ so here im 

PROJECTS : 

#1 Num guessing(1-100) : you guess num and it will give you one hint after 4 attempts and there are limitless guesses 

#2 To-do list          : adds,deletes and sorts the tasks as per their priority
